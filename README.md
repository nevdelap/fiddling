## A Poem About Your Momma

Yo momma's so big when she wakes at dawn,
The sun says "nope" and hits the snooze button,
Her shadow's got its own zip code and lawn,
And birds use her hairdo for a glide pattern.

Yo momma's so old her birth certificate,
Says "expired" in three different languages,
She knew the dinosaurs on a first-name basis, kid,
And her yearbook's in hieroglyphic passages.

Yo momma's so lazy, I'm not gonna lie,
She thought a two-piece suit was too much work,
Her idea of a marathon's a long drawn sigh,
And she makes sloths look like they berserk.

Yo momma's so confused when she sees a door,
She asks it where it wants to go today,
GPS gave up tryna guide her anymore,
And maps just fold themselves and run away.

Yo momma's cooking is so nasty and mean,
The smoke alarm cheers her on in delight,
Gordon Ramsay took one bite and left the scene,
And the garbage disposal filed for civil rights.
