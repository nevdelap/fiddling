## A Poem About Your Momma

Yo momma's so big, when she steps outside,
The earth tilts slightly to the left,
Her shadow's got its own tour guide,
And satellites mistake her for atmospheric heft.

Yo momma's so old, her memory foam mattress
Has actual memories of the Civil War,
She taught Moses how to part the Red Sea's vastness,
And carbon dating gave up trying to keep score.

Yo momma's so lazy, she hired someone else
To breathe for her while she takes a nap,
Her couch has developed its own gravitational stealth,
And even her dreams take frequent coffee breaks, no cap.

Yo momma's so confused, she got lost in her thoughts
And had to call for backup from Search and Rescue,
GPS satellites threw their hands up and fought,
Now Google Maps just shows a big question mark, it's true.

Yo momma's cooking is so astronomically bad,
The fire department sends thank-you cards,
Even the roaches packed their bags and fled,
And Hell's Kitchen relocated to avoid the hazards.
