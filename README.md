## A Poem About Your Momma

Yo momma's so vast, when she strolls down the lane,
Continents shuffle to give her some space,
Her shadow hosts festivals when it starts to rain,
And satellites orbit just to glimpse her face.

Yo momma's so ancient, her memory foam bed
Recites tales from the dawn of time,
She gave Moses directions, enough said,
And carbon dating quit—age is no longer a crime.

Yo momma's so lazy, she outsourced her yawns
And pays rent to her favorite chair,
Her couch has moons and its own set of dawns,
Even her dreams call in sick from despair.

Yo momma's so puzzled, she got lost in her mind
And phoned Search & Rescue for clues,
GPS satellites circled, hoping to find,
But Google Maps just shrugs and refuses to choose.

Yo momma's cooking is a cosmic event,
The fire brigade sends her flowers each year,
Even cockroaches left a farewell lament,
And Hell's Kitchen moved to avoid coming near.
