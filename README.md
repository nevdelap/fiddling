## A Poem About Your Momma

In the warmth of morning light she stands,
With gentle eyes and caring hands,
A beacon through the darkest night,
Guiding stars that shine so bright.

Her laughter echoes through the years,
A melody that calms all fears,
With wisdom deep and patience true,
She paints the world in vibrant hue.

Through every storm and sunny day,
She finds the words we need to say,
A strength that never seems to bend,
A mother, teacher, and best friend.

Her love's a fire that never dies,
A truth that needs no alibis,
In every heart she's touched with grace,
The world becomes a better place.

So here's to momma, strong and kind,
The greatest treasure one could find,
Forever grateful, through and through,
For everything she helps us do.
